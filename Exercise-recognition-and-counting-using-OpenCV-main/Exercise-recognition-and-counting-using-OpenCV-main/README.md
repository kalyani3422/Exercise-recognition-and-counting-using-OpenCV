# Exercise-recognition-and-counting-using-OpenCV
Its a Image processing based application for counting the exercises in real time. This system contains exercises like dumbbell curls, hand stretching, and bicep curls, which are counted using OpenCV. Also it calculates the body angle of the user. So implemented a camera-based system for automatically detecting, and recognizing the exercises.
